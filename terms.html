                Each project with DWC Infrastructure will have a detailed contract that defines the scope, timelines, deliverables, and specifications. Should there be any changes to the project scope, they must be documented and mutually approved in writing, with potential additional charges for modifications. DWC Infrastructure is not responsible for obtaining necessary permits for the project unless explicitly outlined in the contract. Completion timelines provided are estimates and may be subject to adjustment if unforeseen circumstances arise
